# Real-world-Projects
What inspired me working in this project knowing the fact that global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by the time I will have kids.

I picked top 400 video games released since 1977 and analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data. 
Then with the interesting queries I found out the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best and explored the business side of gaming by looking at the sales data. 

I searched by involving joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. Also, I filtered, grouped and ordered data.
